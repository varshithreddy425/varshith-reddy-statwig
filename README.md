I have used React + Vite to complete this project.
<br>
You can follow the below commands in order to run the webpage on your local system after downloading it,
<br>
cd varshith-reddy-statwig
<br>
npm install
<br>
npm run dev

You can also see the final images of the project in different scenarios on Mobile and Desktop Devices.

I uploaded them in the "screenshots" folder.
